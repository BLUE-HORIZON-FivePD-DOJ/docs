## Overview
Webhooks instantly inform your application about significant events, such as payroll submissions or updates, without the need for polling.

### Use Cases:
- Alerting when users submit or create payroll data.
- Notifying upon successful account linkages.
- Triggering actions after data updates.

Webhooks are system-wide, not limited to specific users or accounts, enhancing your application's responsiveness.

### Quick Reference:
- **Webhooks List**: Detailed descriptions of all events you can subscribe to.
- **Setup Guide**: Instructions for subscribing and managing webhooks.

## Setting Up Webhooks

Create a webhook by sending a POST request. Specify which events to monitor and where to send notifications.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.sandbox.goteal.co/webhooks \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-API-KEY: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
    "events": ["user-payroll-submitted", "user-payroll-created"],
    "name": "user-payroll-submitted",
    "secret": "very-secret",
    "url": "https://webhooks.site"
  }'
```
- **events**: Choose events like `user-payroll-submitted` for targeted notifications.
- **name**: Label your webhook for easier management.
- **url**: Your endpoint to receive webhook payloads.
- **secret**: (Optional) A secret for secure webhook verification.

### Verifying Webhooks
Use the provided `secret` to validate incoming webhook signatures, ensuring data integrity and authenticity.

## Webhook Management

### Viewing Subscriptions
List your current webhooks with a simple GET request to our webhook endpoint.

### Updating and Deleting
Modify webhook details or unsubscribe using the webhook ID in PUT or DELETE requests.

## Best Practices

- **Secure Endpoints**: Ensure your webhook URL is HTTPS-secured to safeguard transmitted data.
- **Manage Secrets**: Keep your `secret` confidential and use it to verify webhook payloads.
- **Regular Review**: Periodically check your webhook subscriptions and adjust as needed to match your application's requirements.

Leverage our webhooks to make your application more dynamic and responsive to changes without the overhead of continuous polling.
